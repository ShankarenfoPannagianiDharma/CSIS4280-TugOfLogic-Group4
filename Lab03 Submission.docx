Game:Tug of Logic
  -Multiplayer Game
  -Players: 1 Judge (Instructor) & many Debators (Students)
  
Abstract: 
  A Tug-of-Logic game is a subjective game of debate, wherein debators must pick a side on selected CLAIM: For or Against. Debators then make STATEMENTS supporting their position or detracting the opposition. Each STATEMENT is argued/discussed upon in a single timed BOUT, which debators must live-vote on its truth value (TRUE/FALSE). The Judge can end this bout prematurely at any time. Once all statements have finished their BOUTS, a final vote is made on the CLAIM. After this, debators that have switched sides must now state their reasoning.

      -ask questions during discussions
      -reword the statements to fit discussion

    -switch sides between BOUTS
